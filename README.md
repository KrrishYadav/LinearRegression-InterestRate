# Predicting-Loan-Interest-Rates-with-Linear-Regression
In this project we will be using the publicly available Loan data set to train Linear Regression to predict interest rates assigned to loans.

First, we will clean and prepare the data. This includes feature removal, feature engineering, EDA, visualisation.

Then, we will build machine learning models in Python to predict the interest rates assigned to loans. We will evaluate our models' performances using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric.
